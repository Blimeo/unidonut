# Unidonut
### A platform to meet other university students

### Technologies
React/TypeScript/Go backend/MongoDB

#### Setup
`yarn install` to install dependencies (first-time) 

#### Running the dev server
`yarn start` in root directory to run dev, eventually this will become a monorepo for frontend and backend

#### Roadmap:
- Generate pairings at the beginning of every week based on whether user opts in for that week (default to no)
- Create login system + user profile interface
- Allow user to populate with interests, hobbies, etc
- Create user pairing interface (a la Donut bot), filter by gender (?)
- Create chat interface
- Kind of like "verified Omegle" that's text-only?
